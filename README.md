# api-service
Self-hosted backend service for the Cheatscreen desktop interface. 🌐

Just run it locally along with the `desktop-interface` and hack your interviews for free. All you need is a Claude API key or a local Ollama server.

No $60/mo subscriptions, no ad revenue, we're not like that around here. 😉

### Runbook
Set up your local instance by following [the steps here.](https://github.com/cheatscreen/api-service/blob/main/README.md)

Originally, this was going to be a paid service with a monthly subscription (a //business idea//)

But today's coding interviews create no value for the interviewer and no value for the interviewee

Anti-leetcode tooling like Cheatscreen needs to be freely available for any and all coders, no matter their skillset

If not for passing interviews, then at least as a simple daily reminder: "I'm in charge of my life"

The more we hack the interview process, the more the interview process will be forced to adapt

The more it adapts to our exploits, the more personalized and beautiful it will become

As software engineers, we've become jaded and complacent

Let's change the industry

*every day someone new screams that LC questions are the worst thing about software... but nobody acts... they stay sheep... so we must flip the script ourselves.*
